    <p> Maitha's Commentary: This piece by the wonderful artist Al Reem Al Beshr, a fellow student at NYUAD, perfectly encapsulates my childhood. The upbringing that made me the Emirati woman I am today. This nostalgia is almost forgotten but it is undeniably an unerasable part of my identity. The paper game shown in the film is a common game played by girls in school and between cousins in gatherings where our fingers glide on the paper until we say stop to predict the future of the little girl, “the name of your future husband, how many kids will you have, your name, where your house is.” It is a perfect narration of a childhood that birthed creative and strong willed women writing their own futures instead of letting a game predict it for them in a society of expected outcomes.</p>
