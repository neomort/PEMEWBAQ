    <h3>Artist: Khaled Jarrar </h3>
    <h3>Curator: Maitha</h3>
    <h3><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Artwork: The Piece of Clothing and I’m Good At Shooting, Bad At Painting</a></h3>

    


    <p> Description: the former bodyguard of Yasser Arafat, superbly evokes the Palestinian experience through discomforting situations in his recent show for MOCA, Tucson, where a group of people were taken to an unknown location to view him shoot paint vials. Jarrar cut off pieces of clothing from the audience to expose their stomachs and use it to create the art, he gave the pieces of clothing to the owners after turning them into abstract pieces of art, all marked and signed, referencing an idea that surfaced eight years ago in an article in The Independent, which alleged that modern art was used as a weapon by the CIA. “The CIA used art as a weapon, and I use a weapon to create art,” he says. He anchors the show in his personal experiences, focused on the ongoing Palestinian conflict, drawing parallels between his own use of an AR-15 to create artworks, and the recent killing of more than 60 Palestinians in Gaza, with over 2,700 injured. </p>
