    <p> Description: Malak Mattar makes expressionistic paintings of Palestinian women that have made her a mainstay of Palestinian culture, and an evocative way to communicate about the country and its people through art. “I don’t paint despite war and occupation. I paint because of it. Living through this era of war, there’s a big part of me that wants to document. I have this feeling that everything I do will live longer than me, than everyone. Even with a portrait that has nothing to do with the situation, it is a document because I was the one who painted it.” </p>
