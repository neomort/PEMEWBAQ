    <p> Description: A celebration of the queer community through a traditional cotton cloth called a kanga. Kangas are used in some cultures when the groom's family goes to pick up the bride from her home to his. They're placed on the ground for the bride to walk over as a gesture of goodwill. Mwirichia realized that this gesture is something that queer people in Kenya will not be able to experience due to homophobia. Their love is not celebrated as openly and freely. So she started a project of creating a kanga to represent every country in the world with designs and text on them inspired by the queer experience in said country.
