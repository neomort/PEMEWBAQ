    <h3>Artist: Desire Marea </h3>
    <h3>Curator: Maitha</h3>
    <h3>Artwork:  Tavern Kween Music Video</h3>
    
    


    <p> Description: Subverting the cultural norms of femininity is seen as a risk, but KwaZulu-Natal born Desire Marea revels in the rebellion of the matriarchs who’ve been before. In their Single ‘Tavern Kween’, a track from their album Desire, Desire Marea is the architect of a sonic soundscape growing from within. It starts slowly, like an existing foundation of our own identity that unfurls with every beat, growing skyward as the levels of who we are and who we could be grow. The song is an ode to all of those who “are fierce about claiming their freedom.” The track is layered, like a cacophony of melodic waves crashing onto South Africa’s shores, eroding the past to make way for the present. 
    Desire Marea spoke about how they were harassed at an airport in 2018 whilst on their way to perform at a festival in Berlin as part of their duo FAKA – “The price of visibility is consistent violation”. Yet they continue to reclaim their freedom in public to pave the way for others to do the same.
