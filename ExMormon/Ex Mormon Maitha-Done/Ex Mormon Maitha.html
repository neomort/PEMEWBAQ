    <h3>Artist: Andrew Rollins </h3>
    <h3>Curator: Maitha</h3>
    <h3>Artwork:  CONVERSION 3 Collage (Top) / HOMOMORMON 4 (Bottom)</h3>
    
    


    <p> Description: The CONVERSION series addresses the artist’s 4 years of conversion therapy in preparation for his 2 year Missionary service as a Mormon Missionary. 
Utilizing the historically loaded material of personal classified ads in gay publications from the 80’s. The classified ads, a platform designed to maintain discreteness and to conceal identity; being paired with words or “Labels” in white as a way to cover up and distract the viewer’s eye from seeing what’s underneath. Ultimately unsuccessful, the background is still visible.</p>

<p>The HOMOMORMON series addresses the artist’s 4 years of conversion therapy in preparation for his 2 year Missionary service as a Mormon Missionary. The artist confronts the conflict between their identities: Homosexual man and a fifth generation Mormon. Illustrating the physical and mental struggle with this dichotomy of identity, looking for a solution or at least a place of compromise.
