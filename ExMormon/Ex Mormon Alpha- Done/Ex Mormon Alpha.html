    <h3>“When my dad baptized me at eight years old, they had to close the curtains in the font and coax me into the water. I was afraid because Dad had been telling me he needed to hold me down for a long time to wash away all that sin.”</h1>

    <h3>“Baptism was for the remission of sins. The day of my baptism I became spotless and clean. It should have been a special moment, but looking back, all I could remember was fear. “</h1>

    <h3>“Regardless of destiny, it was ultimately my choice who or what I would become. I would never let myself be swayed by the powers of darkness.“</h1>
